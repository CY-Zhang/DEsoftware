4D STEM image acquisition software developed by Chenyu Zhang.

Tested on DE-16 camera with scan hardware. Current functions include:
1. Whole frame 4D STEM scan with camera running under slave mode or master mode.
2. ROI 4D STEM scan with scan area selected on the acquired HAADF image.
3. 2D HAADF STEM scan without collecting diffraction patterns on the camera.

No multiframe scan or scan repeat options on this version.

Functions designed to control DE server and save data in hdf5 file are still saved in the software but is not used.
