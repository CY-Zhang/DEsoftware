- Updates on image acquisition routine, let DE server save files to MRC format on SSD first, then load it and do reconstruction
	- on my PC, with HDD, the file writing speed is much slower than image acquisition speed and thus limiting the total speed
	- How does DE server calculate the maximum exposure time? Seems maximum exposure time corresponds to 10,000 frames on DE computer and 2048 on my PC
	- Why image simulator would always generate 1k by 1k image no matter what number I use to set ROI?

- To save string metadata in HDF5 file, string has to be converted to ASCii code first, a good example can be found at https://lists.hdfgroup.org/pipermail/hdf-forum_lists.hdfgroup.org/2014-November/008201.html
- An successful example is show here:

	    char[] testChars = new char[] { 'C','h' };
            byte[] asciiStr = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(testChars);
            H5AttributeId attributeId = H5A.create(userGroup, "Board Name", H5T.create(H5T.CreateClass.STRING, 256), H5S.create(H5S.H5SClass.SCALAR));
            H5A.write(attributeId, H5T.create(H5T.CreateClass.STRING, 256), new H5Array<byte>(asciiStr));
            H5A.close(attributeId);

- there should be some more elegent way to convert letters into ASC2 code, the byte[] asciiStr contains long[], each one saves the corresponding ascii code of a letter in it

- Window size needs to be adjustable
- Recon image success, but RAM would be a problem if acquiring too many frames
- 1024*1024 pixels are used by image simulator
- need to reconnect camera before change camera
- stream and reconstruct from DE won't take up RAM,even with lots of beam positions
! Try to read only useful informations from camera and display them in a more efficient way
? where will DE camera save the buffered images in RAM?
! Only do reconstruction if detector is enabled, maybe change 'enable detector' button into a radio button
- checked relationship between imagecount, recon image, and DE preview, things are correct
£¡ Add a button to reset image

! DE server can set total number of acquisitions, need to coordinate this number with the X/Y Positions in software
! Change start/end X/Y into slider
- On DE server, you can change both Binning X/Y and ROI Dimension X/Y, binning factor would be applied on top of ROI dimension, and also ROI offset, not sure what that means
- to display bitmap on image:
	_wBmp = new WriteableBitmap(bmpSource.PixelWidth, bmpSource.PixelHeight, bmpSource.DpiX, bmpSource.DpiY, bmpSource.Format, bmpSource.Palette);
            pictureBox1.Source = _wBmp; // display _wBmp to pictureBox1, will be called only once

- Use more straightforward way to display detector edge, create a ellipse and use a button to control its visibility, the size and thickness of edge can be controlled by two sliders representing inner and outer collection angle
-- default: Ellipse Name="OuterAngle" Height="266" Margin="71,68,60,0" Grid.Row="1" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="2" VerticalAlignment="Top" Visibility="Hidden" 
! Need to solve the problem when input image is not square in pixels
- Functions in DeInterface:
	- 	DeInterfaceNET();
		!DeInterfaceNET();
		~DeInterfaceNET();

		bool connect(String^ ip, int rPort, int wPort);
		bool close();
		bool isConnected();

		bool SetProperty(String^ prop, String^ val);
		bool SetCameraName(String^ name);		

		bool GetCameraNames(List<String^>^% cameras);
		bool GetPropertyNames(List<String^>^% props);
		bool GetProperty(String^ prop, String^% value);
		bool GetImage([Out]array<UInt16, 1> ^%image);
		bool IsInLiveMode();
		bool EnableLiveMode();
		bool DisableLiveMode();
		DeError^ GetLastError();
	private:
		DeInterfaceWin32 *unmanaged;
		bool connected;

- may be able to use SetProperty to set image size along x and y direction
- Number of pixels can be arbitary number?
- tried but not working, so far cannot change image size from software
- How to control how many images to take from software?

- DE12 streaming would keep occupy RAM and won't clean it after streaming stopped. SoftwareSim is ok, DE20 would give error message
- private void DrawEllipseInt(PaintEventsArgs e) is added to try to draw a circle representing the aperture
- Paint property is for pictureBox, not for image
- all button needs to be under class MainWindow
- Window : System.windows

- Need to copy all .dll files in HDF5DotNet folder to C:\Windows\System32 to run 
- Consider to include the .dll file for HDF5DotNet in the code
- The HDF5 file is currently saved under bin/x64/Debug, and the current version cannot debug with x86/64bit
