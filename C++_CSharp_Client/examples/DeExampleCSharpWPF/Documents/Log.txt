! DE server can set total number of acquisitions, need to coordinate this number with the X/Y Positions in software
! Change start/end X/Y into slider
- On DE server, you can change both Binning X/Y and ROI Dimension X/Y, binning factor would be applied on top of ROI dimension, and also ROI offset, not sure what that means

- Use more straightforward way to display detector edge, create a ellipse and use a button to control its visibility, the size and thickness of edge can be controlled by two sliders representing inner and outer collection angle
-- default: Ellipse Name="OuterAngle" Height="266" Margin="71,68,60,0" Grid.Row="1" Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="2" VerticalAlignment="Top" Visibility="Hidden" 
! Need to solve the problem when input image is not square in pixels

	- 	DeInterfaceNET();

- may be able to use SetProperty to set image size along x and y direction
- Number of pixels can be arbitary number?
- tried but not working, so far cannot change image size from software
- How to control how many images to take from software?

- DE12 streaming would keep occupy RAM and won't clean it after streaming stopped. SoftwareSim is ok, DE20 would give error message
- private void DrawEllipseInt(PaintEventsArgs e) is added to try to draw a circle representing the aperture
- Paint property is for pictureBox, not for image
- all button needs to be under class MainWindow
- Window : System.windows

- Need to copy all .dll files in HDF5DotNet folder to C:\Windows\System32 to run 
- Consider to include the .dll file for HDF5DotNet in the code
- The HDF5 file is currently saved under bin/x64/Debug, and the current version cannot debug with x86/64bit
